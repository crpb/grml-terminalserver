TODOs for grml-terminalserver
-----------------------------

  * resolv.conf should be copied from the initrd
  * DON'T delete /var/lib/tftpdboot on a !grml-system
  * config vars to use external services (dhcp, tftp, nfs)
  * make pxelinux configurable (to use another pxe-boot-manager) (MAYBE)
  * default dhcp range not from 0.1-254 but from 0.2-253
  * build binaries (timeout, udhcpc,...) from source
