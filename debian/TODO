TODOs for grml-terminalserver
-----------------------------

  * DON'T delete /var/lib/tftpdboot on a !grml-system
  * config vars to use external services (dhcp, tftp, nfs)
  * make pxelinux configurable (to use another pxe-boot-manager) (MAYBE)
  * don't write to /etc/grml/terminalserver
  * don't recreate the config on every grml-terminalserver start
  * introduce a special config rewrite commando
  * verify config option to change location of grml image + cd mountpoint
  * autodetection of kernelversion from grml image
  * write a small script to create the netboot packages
