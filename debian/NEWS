grml-terminalserver (0.99.7) unstable; urgency=low

  This release drops support for generating PXE enabled grub images.
  The grml team recommends usage of Etherboot/gPXE instead. According
  images are available on http://www.etherboot.org/ as well as
  directly within grml's bootmenu (Addons -> Run GPXE) starting with
  release 2009.10.
